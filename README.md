spring-graphql-cars
---

This is a spring boot graphQL server project initially  based on the excellent post by [Issam GUISSOUMA](https://medium.com/@iguissouma/rapid-development-of-simple-crud-graphql-apis-in-java-and-spring-boot-bafc4e8d387a)

While the initial setup is based on the article , the idea of this project is to make it a comprehensive graphQL sample based on SpringBoot 2
Items to be covered

* Comprehensive documentation and tests
* Add samples for NoSQL databases
* Add more complete ORM relationships backed by graphQL
* Add sample for external APIs 
* Add Reactive Extensions
